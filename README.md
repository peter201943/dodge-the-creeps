# Dodge the Creeps

"Dodge the Creeps!"  Godot Engine 3.0 "getting started" game demonstrating the basics.  
This game is a companion to the Godot Engine 3.0 Getting Started Guide: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html  

## It is a game intended to demonstrate the following fundamental concepts of Godot development:  
 - Node and scene structure
 - Instancing scenes
 - Input
 - Signals
 - UI

## I have tried doing this in both:  
 - GDScript (godot)
 - C# (mono)
